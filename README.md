### The idea of the project: Supply chain companies transparently put their transactions in Blockchain. We evaluate their carbon footprint and assign them ### G-Score. Lower the G-score the more carbon neutral they are. We use G-score to create a store where people get to assess the products based on their ### carbon neutrality before buying them.
